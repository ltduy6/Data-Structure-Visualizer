# Data Structure Visualizer

## Description
This is my solo project for the Data Structures course in my university. It is sometimes difficult for me to understand some abstract concept of data structures such as Graph and AVL tree. Therefore, I want to create an application to visualize some data structures by animation. This application is inspired by VisuAlgo

## Installation
You need to install raylib. There are various ways to do it, you can read from here [Working on Windows - raysan5/raylib GitHub Wiki](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows). Once you have raylib of the latest version, you can open this project in Visual Studio and run.

## Usage
I have a demonstration video in [Data Structure Visualizer](https://youtu.be/wkQWksFGwvM)
