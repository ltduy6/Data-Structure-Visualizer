# Data Structure Visualizer

## Description
This is my solo project for the Data Structures course in my university. It is sometimes difficult for me to understand some abstract concept of data structures such as Graph and AVL tree. Therefore, I want to create an application to visualize some data structures by animation. This application is inspired by VisuAlgo
